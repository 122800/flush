"
ITM9|Implementation Plan|"
# Code-Complexity Consideration:

In favour of initial feature-development efficiency
we choose to forego aspirations of 'proper' implementation
using such alien technologies
as TypeScript,
HTML modules,
and the like.

As such, the initial build plan is
to simply use current knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS
to achieve functionality in an intuitive manner.

Additionally,
[ITM15] would have required implementation
of the full-blown CRUD-pub/sub framework.
Appropriate shortcuts will instead be taken
to avoid this complexity.
"
ITM10|Methodology|"
Specific design choices and principles are outlined here in 'Methodology'.

* Project layout:
  ./src             : Code assets
  ./src/index.html  : Main file / Starting point

For simplicity we may choose to combine all assets
in a single file,
to begin with.
