ITM9|Implementation Plan|"
# Code-Complexity Consideration:

In favour of initial feature-development efficiency
we choose to forgo aspirations of 'proper' implementation
using such alien technologies
as TypeScript,
HTML modules,
and the like.

As such, the initial build plan is
to simply use current knowledge of JS, HTML and CSS
to achieve functionality in an intuitive manner.

Additionally,
[ITM15] would have required implementation
of the full-blown CRUD-pub/sub framework.
Appropriate shortcuts will instead be taken
to avoid this complexity.

# Implementing [ITM13] (Score Calculation)

An HTML 'form' element is used
because it allows centralized event-handling
of all child elements.

To avoid submitting arbitrary tags to the scope of the 'form' tag,
the 'form' element will be defined separately
and referenced by detached 'input' elements.

In order to capture changes to [ITM8] elements,
their data will be stored in HTML 'input' elements.
This means that all features need to be reviewed
for compatibility or conflicts with this change.
Given that each 'input' can only have one 'form_id' tag,
it also means that the form must potentially comply
with a scope greater than only the [ITM13] feature.

The chosen scope is 'ITM8-gains-collection'
with one 'form' element per player,
and we'll see how it goes.

And actually you can use the HTML 'output' element for this!

# Data Model

No proper JS data model is currently maintained,
game data (ITM23) is stored in HTML
and extracted into JS as needed for manipulation.
"|""
ITM10|Methodology|"
Specific design choices and principles are outlined here in 'Methodology'.

* Project layout:
  ./src             : Code assets
  ./src/index.html  : Main file / Starting point

For simplicity we may choose to combine all assets
in a single file,
to begin with.

P1
* [ITM5] Remove a player from the game
P3

  for new-comers/quitters
* Ranking operation (ITM18) should be aware of invalidated rank
  when points change
  (let go of 'sorted' indication?)
* Control & sanitize user input
P4
* Configure relevant HTML 'meta' tags
  https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp

- The sort can be applied from:
  * Player name (ITM6) (the default)
  * Player gains (ITM8) for a round
  * Player score (ITM14)
- The availability of the ranking functionality
  should be indicated to the user.

"|""
ITM20|Feature: Accidental Reset Protection|"
A security mechanism is in place
to avoid accidentally losing the game data (ITM23).

Managed risk situations:
Reloading the page.
Closing the tab.
Closing the browser.

Some usage constraints are identified in [ITM32].

Implementation:
All game data (ITM23) is saved as [ITM32] on modification.
[ITM32] is loaded into the playing area on startup (ITM25) if present.
"|""

* [ITM22] BFCache Incompatibility
"|""
ITM22|Issue: BFCache Incompatibility|"

ITM32|Concept: Local Datastore|"
The serialized representation of all game data (ITM23)

  Data model:
  ```
  [
    {
      "ITM6": "Player1",
      "ITM8": ["5", "10", "", "", "", ""]
    }
  ]
